# Keymap intuition
- `hjkl` for direct navigation, `tab`/`<s-tab>` for next/prev navigation
- tiers:
    - `<super-` for inter-window.
    - `<super-s-` for moving window.
    - `<c-` for inner-window.
    - `<c-s-` for big moves and when mapping is already used.
    - `<s-` only for inline selection things.
- keep modifiers pressed, `<c-k> + <c-o>` rather than `<c-k> + o`
- `f`(find) for sneaking (vim/vimium)
- `a` for mastering current view. (`<super-a>` for window and `<c-s-a>` for moving tab to new window as master)
